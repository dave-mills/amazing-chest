    <b>Amazing Chest</b> adds a new 'Sorting Chest' block to your world.  Sorting Chests will automatically
    pull matching items into themselves from any connected hopper chain.
</p>
<p>
    It works a lot like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNV9Mo00Gw"Tango Tek</a> sorting system
    (but without actually having to build one).
</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Super easy item sorting setup</li>
    <li>Reorganize the sorter at any time by just moving items to different chests</li>
    <li>Sort both stackable and unstackable items</li>
    <li>Works with the Fabric modloader</li>
    <li>Can work without being installed in the client (thanks to the awesome <a href='https://polymer.pb4.eu'>Polymer
        framework</a>)
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I use a Sorting Chest?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        Create a chain of hoppers like shown.
    </li>
    <li>
        Put items in the chests that you want to show up in those chests.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure there's a regular 'overflow' chest somewhere on the chain to accept items that
        don't match any of the Sorting Chests.
    </li>
</ul>



<p></p>

<h3>How does it work exactly?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        When a Sorting Chest is connected to a hopper chain, any items in the chain that match items in the
        Sorting Chest will automatically be routed into it.
    </li>
    <li>
        A Sorting Chest will never allow a hopper to push items into it that don't match an item it already
        contains.
    </li>
    <li>
        Also, if a hopper pulls items out of a Sorting Chest, it will never pull the last item of a given
        type.  This ensures that the Sorting Chest will continue to sort items the items you put into it.
    </li>
    <li>They always keep the last item of a type that is held in the hopper.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    So, just put an item in one of the regular hopper slots to "set" a filter. That item will never be pulled or pushed
    out of the hopper. And the hopper will now only accept items of that type.
</p>

<h3>Lithium Users Read This!</h3>
<p>
    If you also use Lithium, Copper Hoppers won't work unless you set <code>mixin.block.hopper=false</code>
    in your <code>lithium.properties</code> file.  This will disable Lithium's hopper-related optimizations
    that are incompatible with Copper Hoppers.  (Courtesy of <a href='https://www.curseforge.com/members/valkonmc'>valkonmc</a>)

    <li>I will not be doing a Forge port of Amazing Chest. (sorry)</li>
